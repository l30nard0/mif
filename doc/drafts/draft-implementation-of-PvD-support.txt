1.  Introduction

   TBD.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  PvD-manager Implementation

   PvD-manager is a client-side component for IPv6 network auto-
   configuration based on multiple provisioning domains (PvDs), as
   described in RFC 6418 [RFC6418] and RFC 7556 [RFC7556].  PvD-manager
   is orthogonal to existing system, which means it does not interfere
   with regular network behavior: none of the services and settings used
   by Network Manager and similar components are not changed nor
   affected.  Implementation and documentation for PvD-manager is
   available at its git repository [PvD-manager].

2.1.  Architecture

   PvDs are implemented through Linux network namespaces.  For each
   coherent PvD information set received on the network interface, PvD-
   manager creates a separate network namespace and configures received
   network parameters within that namespace.  Since each network
   namespace uses separate IP stack which is isolated from other
   namespaces, potentially conflicting network parameters received from
   different network providers can safely coexist on a single host.
   PvD-manager manages only those newly created namespaces associated
   with the PvDs and their network settings and leaves the default
   network namespace intact.  That way, all the existing network
   management components, such as Network Manager, continue to work
   unobtrusively.

   Figure 1 presents an overview of a system and its components which
   uses PvD-manager.

               Figure 1: PvD prototype architecture overview

   PvD-manager receives network configurations through Router
   Advertisement (RA) messages.  Modified version of PvD aware radvd
   daemon [radvd] is used.  Each RA may contain one or more network
   configurations which are classified either as explicit or implicit
   PvDs.  Explicit PvD is a set of coherent NDP options explicitly
   labeled with a unique PvD identifier and nested within a special NDP
   option called PVD container, as described in draft-ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-
   support-02 [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support].  Multiple explicit PvDs
   may appear in a single RA, each within a different PvD container

   option, as long as they are labeled with different PvD identifiers.
   Implicit PvD is just another name for top-level NDP options placed
   outside the PvD container option, as in regular PvD unaware router
   advertisements.  Since implicit PvDs are not labeled with PvD
   identifier, PvD-manager automatically generates an identifier for
   internal use and configures the implicit PvD on the host in the same
   way as if it was the explicit one.  Only one implicit PvD is allowed
   per RA.  In current prototype, UUID is used as a PvD identifier.

   Each PvD, either explicit or implicit, is associated with a network
   namespace with a single virtual network interface (besides the
   loopback) of macvlan type, where PvD-related network parameters are
   configured.  To establish a connectivity to the outside world,
   virtual interface is connected to the physical interface on which the
   related PvD information is received through the RA.  Each virtual
   interface is assigned a link-local IPv6 address (fe80::/64) and one
   or more addresses derived from Prefix Information options if present
   in the received RA.  Besides the IP addresses, PvD-manager configures
   the routing tables and DNS records within the namespace.  By default,
   a link-local and default route via the RA-announcing router are added
   to the routing table, regardless of the routing information received
   in RA.  Additional routing information is configured if Route
   Information options are received in RA.  Finally, for each RDNSS and
   DNSSL option received in RA, PvD-manager creates a record in
   /etc/netns/NETNS_NAME/resolv.conf, where NETNS_NAME is a name of the
   network namespace associated with the PvD.

   PvD aware client application uses PvD API to get a list of available
   PvDs configured on the local host, and activate chosen PvD to use it
   for communication.  Information about configured PvDs are exposed to
   applications by a special PvD service running on local host.  D-Bus
   is used to connect applications to PvD service.  Upon PvD activation,
   client application is switched to the network namespace associated
   with the selected PvD.  Further network operations (socket creation,
   sending and receiving data) are performed within that namespace.
   Once obtained by the application, socket handles are linked to the
   network namespace they were originally obtained from and continue to
   work in that namespace, regardless of whether the application
   switches to another namespace at some time later.  This enables the
   application to use multiple PvDs simultaneously.  The only
   requirement is that the application is running within a proper
   network namespace while obtaining a socket.

   PvD unaware clients operate as before.  Although they are not able to
   use PvD API to select a certain PvD, they can still be forced to use
   a specific PvD by starting them in a network namespace associated
   with that PvD.  To run a program within a given namespace, it should
   be started with:

      ip netns exec <pvd-namespace-name> <command with args>

   or they can be started with provided launchers ("pvd_run" and
   "pvd_prop_run").

   As per RFC 7556 [RFC7556], implemented PvD system provides basic,
   intermediate and advanced PvD support (in APIs) for client
   applications.  Only difference is that our basic support doesn't
   provide automatic selection for PvD unaware application - it must be
   started with PvD launcher with manual selection of PvD.  Intermediate
   and advanced PvD support require some additional properties
   (metadata) provided with PvD.  Next section describe used mechanism
   to provide such information to PvD-manager which then provide such
   information to client applications.

2.2.  PvD Properties

   With RA messages routers provides network related parameters for
   PvDs.  Other parameters that can be used to detail properties of
   particular PvD (an application can use them to better select PvD) in
   this draft are called "PvD properties" or just "properties".

   In this prototype implementation, PvD properties are also provided by
   router, but only on request, using HTTP protocol on router's link-
   local address, using port 8080.  Router's link-local address is saved
   by PvD-manager when RA was received.

   Upon receiving PvD information from router, PvD-manager tries to get
   a file with PvD properties from the same router.  If such file
   exists, network related PvD parameters are extended with ones
   (properties) from received file.

   Client application receives all those additional properties from PvD-
   manager, and may select appropriate PvD based on them.

   Current implementation is very rudimentary: files on router are in
   JSON format.  PvD-manager interpret them - create a dictionary of
   them, but only because PvD-manager it's written in Python and using
   JSON is easy, while client applications are written in C.  In real
   implementation this should be reversed - only client should interpret
   file with PvDs' properties.

   Properties used in this prototype are just an example ("name",
   "type", "bandwidth", "price"), not to be used in some protocol
   specification.  We presented one mechanism to provide additional PvD
   properties obtained by some mechanism (not by RAs) and let client
   application decide what to do with them.

2.3.  Deployment

2.3.1.  Routers, DNS Servers

   PvD architecture assumes presence of at least one router which runs
   modified version of radvd daemon [radvd].  Through RA messages,
   router conveys network related parameters to client host (prefix,
   routes, DNS servers and domains).  Router should also provide PvD
   properties, using an HTTP server on port 8080 attached to router's
   link-local IP address.

Internet-Draft  An implementation of PvD support in Linux     March 2016


   DNS servers aren't part of PvD architecture but could be used to
   demonstrate that different PvDs can use different DNS servers.

2.3.2.  PvD-manager, Client Applications

   PvD-manager is a daemon for client host.  Currently PvD-manager
   consists of several modules.  Main module maintain PvD information,
   creates, updates and deletes namespaces.  NDP module listens for RA
   messages, parse them and forward them to main module.  API server
   module listens for client application requests (using d-bus) and
   responds to them, but also send signals to clients when a change
   occurred in PvDs.

   Before starting a network connection, PvD aware client application
   should first request PvDs from PvD-manager.  Next, one PvD should be
   selected (activated) and only then network connection(s) created.  If
   other PvDs are required (later or in parallel), same procedure must
   be followed: select PvD first and then create connections.
   Connection will continue to operate within PvD in which was created,
   regardless of PvDs selected later.

   PvD unaware application should be started with PvD launcher to use
   certain PvD.  Otherwise, such application will behave as PvDs weren't
   present ("as usual").

2.4.  Implementation Details

   Proposed PvD architecture is based on Linux namespaces as PvD
   isolation mechanism.  Isolation namespaces provide resolve many
   issues about overlapping and conflicting network parameters for
   different PvDs.  However, they also impose some requirements that may
   limit usage in certain environment, especially ones based on public
   IPv4 addresses.  One of the main problem with namespaces is that each
   namespace requires an IP address (since namespace emulates network
   from link-layer and up).

   Only IPv6 is used in implementation.  Main reasons include using RA
   messages as PvD information provider and unrestricted generation of
   IPv6 address per PvD.

   A library is created with interfaces (API) for PvD operations,
   currently only for programs in C programming language.  For
   communication between client application (using provided API) and
   PvD-manager d-bus service is used.  Implemented interface include PvD
   retrieval methods (pvd_get_by_id, pvd_get_by_properties), PvD
   selection (pvd_activate) and registration for events when PvDs change
   (pvd_register_signal).  Sample test applications are created, which
   demonstrate API usage and PvD system possibilities.

   PvD-manager is implemented in Python 3 for rapid prototyping and
   availability of network managing modules (mainly pyroute2 and
   netaddr).

   More details about implementation of PvD-manager is available in its
   documentation [PvD-manager].

2.5.  Test Scenarios

   Test scenarios used for validating implementations include a system
   with one client host, two routers and two hosts that act as servers,
   as presented on Figure 3.  All hosts are running as virtual machines.

          Figure 3: Network configuration used in test scenarios

   All server hosts, including routers have configured HTTP and DNS
   servers providing many possibilities for testing.  Routers, in RAs
   advertise prefixes as shown on Figure 3.  Local addresses are used in
   explicit PvDs (simulating some specific service), while public in
   implicit.

   Example network configurations from RFC 7556 [RFC7556] are simulated
   with Figure 3 with various applications on Client and servers S1 and
   S2.  S1 is accessible by client only through implicit PvD provided by
   R1, while S2 similarly, only over PvD provided by R2.

   If S1 simulate one service, and S2 another, client application can
   select PvD based on service required and connect to S1 or S2.  Or a
   PvD aware application can use both in parallel.

   VPN was simulated by a tunnel between Client and S2, created within
   implicit PvD provided by R2.  Then tunnel was added as another PvD.
   S2 for this scenario had local address (and prefix)as local addresses
   on R2 network: there were two PvDs with same prefix on Client.
   However, client applications running in those two different PvDs for

   the same local IP address (fd02::1) connected with different servers:
   one with R2, and another (which used "VPN" PvD) with S2.

   In some scenarios both S1 and S2 were connected to both routers R1
   and R2.  In this scenarios better PvD could be chosen for connecting
   with servers, if properties for PvDs are provided.  Also, when some
   connection fails - when some PvD loses connectivity, application can
   reset connections, refresh PvD availability from PvD-manager and
   chose again among active PvDs.

   More details for described scenarios and some other are provided in
   demonstration test cases [PvD-manager].

2.6.  Experiences gained

   Present some experience gained from the implementation.  What do you
   think was good?  What would you do differently if you were to
   implement this again.  What about language/environment, was it good,
   what was bad?

3.  NetworkManager implementation

   TBD.

4.  Server component

   Write about changes in the radvd component.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.
