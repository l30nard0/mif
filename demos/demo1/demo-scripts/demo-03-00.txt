This script demonstrate PvD aware applications that wants specific PvD defined
by its properties. If such PvD doesn't exist, other PvD is searched with other
(less restrictive) properties.

For example, if free internet is available, an application can start downloading
some large content (e.g. update). If free internet isn't available, application
can choose to do some other low bandwith operations with remote server
(e.g. synchronize contacts with ones stored on remote server).

In this demo, "free" "internet" PvD is asked for first.
If available, movie is streamed (or downloaded).
If not available, "internet" PvD is asked for.
If available, audio is streamed.
If no PvD has "internet" type, error is printed.
