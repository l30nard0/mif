This demo simulate VPN in separate PvD.
IP addresses in VPN are the same as in local network (C-R2).

For this simulation several changes were required:
- to simulate VPN tunnel from C to S2 is used (ip6gre/ip6ip6)
- on client, tunnel is moved to new namespace VPNTEST
- modified version of pvdman is used:
  * special PvD is inserted into pvdman (without any network operation)

Starting simulation:
- create tunnels on C and S2 run:
  $ sudo ./demo-30-01-C+S2-tunnel.sh create
- run pvdman (with --demo 30 flag):
  $ sudo ./demo-30-02-C-start-pvdman.sh start
- start demo apps:
  $ sudo ./demo-30-03-C-start-apps.sh


Web server is contacted on "local" address fd02::1.
When in "local fd02" PvD web server on R2 is contacted.
When in "vpn fd02" PvD web server on S2 is contacted.
