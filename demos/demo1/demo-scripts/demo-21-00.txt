This demo is similar with demo-20. However, client always choose best PvD
announced by the system (MIF-pvdman) regardless if its working or not.


For this script prepare newtork setup as shown in demo-00-00-readme.txt.

Scripts demo-21* use program "pvd_echo_client_signal" (from testapps).

Program "pvd_echo_client_signal" tries to reach service on server S1
("on Internet") using best possible connection:
1. if PVD with "internet" + "free" is available use it first
2. if "internet" + "free" isn't available, search for PVD with "internet"
3. if PVD with "internet" isn't available retry and retry ...


When multiple PVDs are available, program also (as info only) prints a list
of all available PVDs. This is helpful because it shows when some PVD appeared
or dissapeared from system (pvdman).

Using this program several system properties are shown:
- adaptable MIF aware application
  * choose best PVD available
  * recheck for better PVD after receiving a signal about change in PvDs
- dynamical addition and deletion of PVDs
  * pvdman periodically pings routers: when no response all its PVDs are removed
- operations with network interfaces and namespaces (with python) slows down
  system drastically (only when operations are performed)
- implementation has bugs :(

Results from one run are presented and commented in "demo-21-xx-out-0.txt".

Script "demo-21-02-C-pvd-retry.sh" is used to start "pvd_echo_client_signal".
$ sudo ./demo-21-02-C-pvd-retry.sh

Script "demo-21-01-R-start-stop.sh" can be used to automate test on routers.
$ sudo ./demo-21-01-R-start-stop.sh start -- will start services on router
$ sudo ./demo-21-01-R-start-stop.sh stop  -- will stop services on router and
  also disable interface which connect it to client (so that pvdman can detect
  that router is offline)
